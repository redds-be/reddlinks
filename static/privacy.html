            By default, reddlinks (the web application you are currently using) does not save any of these logs, whether these logs are saved depend on this site's administrator. A good example is when running the application as a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/daemon.html" target="_blank">systemD daemon</a> where logs are saved by default.<br>
            <em>Please note that this log policy concerns the logs saved by reddlinks (the web application you are currently using) and not the web server, the extent on which requests are logged depend on the web server's configuration used by this site's administrator.</em>

        <h3>Removal of data</h3>
        <p class="privacy">
            To remove the data you directly or indirectly provided, you can try to contact this site's administrator.<br>
            <em>Please note that reddlinks (the web application you are currently using) does not have the capacity in any way shape or form to force this site's administrator to honor such requests, despite any laws or regulations. It is up to the site's administrator to be contactable and to respect said laws and regulations.
